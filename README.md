[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mg14/CoxHD.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mg14/CoxHD)

An R package with high-dimensional extensions of the Cox proportional hazards model.

It includes:

####CoxRFX: A random effects model
This model assumes a shared normal distribution of effect sizes. The data can be partitioned into groups with different effect mean and variance. 
It can be useful for fitting $n\approx p$ dimensions.
 
####CoxCPSS: Complementary pairs stability selection
Stability selection is used for variable selection. Error control is possible based on the log-concave model by Shah and Samworth.
